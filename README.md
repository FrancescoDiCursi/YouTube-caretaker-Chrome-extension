# YouTube-caretaker-Chrome-extension (PC ONLY)
A Chrome extension that allows the user to attend a collective annotation project, see risk scores and block undesired channels.

Users' suggestions will be used to calculate risk scores and will be visible to all users.

Scores will be computed in a given interval (e.g., once every 2 weeks).

:warning: This is a prototype and some bugs may be present. This is a long-term annotation project for future attempts of automatic recognition of unsafe channels thorugh user/channel activties.
